# Setting up local development environment
This package uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project management.
You will need to install uv to develop this package.

First clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MCV-2025-C1-Project/Team7.git
```

Then we can ask uv to set up the local environment.
```shell
cd file-tree
uv sync
```
